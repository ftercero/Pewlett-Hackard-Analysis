- There are 1,549 current employees eligible for the mentorship program.
- Each year, there will be at least 21,000 employees eligible for retirement
### Summary:
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
There are a total of over 90,000 employees that are eligible for retirement. Ideally, employees will retire as soon as they have reached retirement age. This means that employees born in 1952 will retire first then employees born the following year and so on. The table below demonstrates how many employees are eligible for retirement each year.

| Birth Year | Number of Eployees |
|------------|--------------------|
|   1952     |     21,209         |
|   1953     |     22,857         |
|   1954     |     23,228         |
|   1955     |     23,104         |

With the overwhelming number of employees eligible for retirement each year, there are enough employees to mentor the new generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees.
